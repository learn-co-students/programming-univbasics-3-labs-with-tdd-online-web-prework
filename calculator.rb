# Add your variables here
first_number = 10 
second_number = 3

# Sum of the Variables
sum = first_number + second_number

# Difference of the Variables
difference = first_number - second_number

# Product of the Variables
product = first_number * second_number

# Dividing of the Variables
quotient = first_number / second_number
